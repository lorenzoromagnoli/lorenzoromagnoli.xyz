In 2016 as part of my involvement in the developmetn of a IoT strategy for Arduino I contributed to the conceptualization and the design of the first iteration of the Arduino Cloud platform.
At the time the platform was already featuring a way to monitor some devices status from the distance, the idea of object properties preserved in the current platforn and the possibility of automatic code tempalte generation.

The platform was designed with simplicity in mind: as well as the other Arduino products it is usable by beginners, and pro-users.

Although the platform went trough a series of iterations it maintains the core element I contributed to develop. Check it out [here](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/)
