Wink is like a dog that makes you interact with other people. It has autonomous behaviour and it cannot be cotrolled by the user.

While you are cycling, Wink expresses itself by moving the pupil and by making little sounds.
When Wink detects someone, it tries to communicate with the other and attract his attention. The moment of awkward curiosity created acts as an icebreaker between the two cyclists. It will trigger some kind of communication or at least will be an excuse to exchange a smile.
When multiple Winks meet each other they get excited and start talking to each other. When more winks are together, the conversation between them becomes more chaotic.
Eventually cyclists will feel sorry to separate the Winks and they will cycle together; hopefully starting a conversation.
