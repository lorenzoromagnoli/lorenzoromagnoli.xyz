JUMP project commissioned by tvilight JULY 2013

Tvilight asked us to develop an intelligent product service system that would extend their activities towards the dense urban area. They currently produce an intelligent street lighting solution that dims when there is no activity on the street, saving up to 80% in energy consumption.

We developed a concept and a network of sensors capable of detecting the availability of free parking lot in town.

The sensor was running on battery and installed underground between two or more parking lot.

A profile matching algorithm was used to determine how many cars and in which configuration they were parked.
