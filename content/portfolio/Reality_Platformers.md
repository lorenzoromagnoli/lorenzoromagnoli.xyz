As we drive through the city in a cab or we travel the countryside on a train, our attention mostly gravitates around the screen in our hands. The landscape and the context around us often fades out of focus.
### Could we trick kids and adults into using a phone to look outside of the phone again?

What if the ‘reality’ outside the a car or a train window could become a continuous platform to play with? Using a mix of ARCore and Machine Vision we explored new interactions with streets, objects and landscapes that we drive through.

Using a mix of ARCore and Machine Vision we explored new interactions with streets, objects and landscapes that we drive through. Eventually We designed and quickly prototype 3 playful experiences.
