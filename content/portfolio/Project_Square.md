Project Square is an open education initiative that makes it easy and fun for educators to bring computational thinking into the classroom, beyond the screens. Developed in an interdisciplinary setting together with researchers, entrepreneurs and educators, it is based on frameworks and research evidence from the science of learning.

The toolkit, designed to be used in group activities in class, is made of simple materials which are easy reproducible in any school. It comes with a set of exercises and activities built on the most fundamental comcept of computation like sequences, algorithms and conditions.

From the beginning we wanted the kit to be a platform able to support educators in ideatining developing, and sharing new activities with a wider network. Because of this, from the beginning of the process we tried to involved in our process as many educators, technology experts and kids as possible. At each iterations we ran several creative sessions to evaluate our design and ideate new activities.
