Foxtron approached Pininfarina for the design of the Model D, a large seven-seat Lifestyle Multipurpose Utility Vehicle (LMUV). Pininfarina worked on the complete project, styling the exterior, interior, and digital user experience. The result is an impressive showcar presented at Foxconn’s Tech Days in October 2024.

In collaboration with our interior and visual designers, we developed a HMI theme we call "Scenic." This theme is characterized by a minimalist approach to screen space, treating the display as a blank canvas. We prioritize clarity through generous use of white space, ensuring that only essential information is presented. Real-time 3D renders enhance the overall premium digital experience.

A significant challenge in this project was the ultra-large screen, designed to serve both driver and passenger. Our goal was to adhere closely to the original design vision, treating the entire surface as a unified display without harsh divides between applications.

To streamline user experience, we limited multitasking capabilities, allowing one application on the left and one on the right side of the screen. Ample white space was utilized to create a harmonious integration between the apps.

The map plays a crucial role, serving both functional and decorative purposes. We experimented with various map styles, ultimately opting for a minimalistic design that subtly indicates user location while remaining aesthetically pleasing. Our customized map displays only land and water, resulting in a distinct yet abstract representation of specific areas.

For the Driver Information Module (DIM), we aimed to align closely with the Car Status Display (CSD). To showcase the advanced technical capabilities of FOXTRON, we conceptualized an innovative real-time visualization that merges sensor and camera data with map and location information. Our objective was to present key driver information in a clear, straightforward manner while preserving the airy, open ambiance of the selected theme.

The result is a beautifully rendered real-time concept that integrates seamlessly with the premium design of the vehicle's interior.
