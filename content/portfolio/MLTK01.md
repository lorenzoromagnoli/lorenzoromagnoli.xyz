This toolkit allows designers to cut out hardware prototyping time and focus on the design of interactions with tangible learning things, giving space to explorations of unconventional data sources and to the creative craft of behaviors.

As we strive for open approaches to education, we combined hardware and software from two existing open source tools: Arduino and ml5js.

An Arduino nano BLE Sense is connected to the MLTK01 PCB, functioning as a tangible interface. It allows you to simply plug, train and play with machine learning sketches.
The MLTK01 library extends the ml5js javascript library with a rich set of API to connect the browser with the board through Web BLE API, facilitating the process of reading sensors and controlling the physical actuators connected to the board

MLTK01 allows to eliminate the need for developing a communication protocol and writing a custom firmware for the hardware used. Removing this process generates benefits for the user as it saves time, but foremost is a crucial benefit not only because saves time, but foremost because it lowers the barrier for designers with low technical expertise to engage with ML explorations.
