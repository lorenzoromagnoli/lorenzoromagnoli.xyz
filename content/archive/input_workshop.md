[Arduino Cloud](http://cloud.arduino.cc) is a new addition to the [Arduino Create](http://create.arduino.cc) platform.
The goal of the platform is to give user a easy way to connect their Arduino Boards to the internet, monitor the status of its devices and connect one board to the other.
The platform was designed with simplicity in mind: as well as the other Arduino products it is usable by beginners, and pro-users.

The project, developed the web team internal to Arduino, is still on going, and many features will be implemented in the coming months.
